## Lightning Features
Contains Lightning's Layout, Preview, Media, and Workflow modules.

Lightning Layout, Ligtning Media, and Lightning Workflow are automatically
installed by default, but you can choose which ones, if any, you want to
install.

Lightning Preview is experimental and therefore NOT installed by default.
You must explicitly choose to install it. Experimental modules are not
considered stable and it is strongly recommended that you do NOT enable them
on a production site.
